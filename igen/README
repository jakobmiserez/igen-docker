       Topology generation through network design heuristics
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

IGen is a network topology generator. Unlike GT-ITM and BRITE,
IGen does not rely on probabilistic methods to generate network
topologies. Since real networks are the outcome of a careful network
design, IGen implements various network design heuristics such
as MENTOR, MENTour, Delaunay triangulation and Two Trees for the
purpose of building network topologies.

IGen is written in Perl/Tk and is provided under the LGPL
