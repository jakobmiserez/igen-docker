       Topology generation through network design heuristics
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation instructions
-------------------------

IGen is written in Perl/Tk. In order to use it, you first have to
unarchive it in a dedicated directory. To run it, just type

  ./igen-gui.pl


Requirements
------------

In order to be run, IGen will need a recent version of Perl compiled
with threads. I use Perl v5.8.6 but other versions might work as
well. Run 'perl -version' in order to check the version of Perl on
your computer.

In addition, IGen will need the Perl/Tk module. You can install it
on your computer using the 'cpan' utility: 'cpan Tk'

IGen also require the CPAN Graph-0.20105 module as well as the CPAN
Statistics module.
